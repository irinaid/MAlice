  z was a letter of 'z'.
  arr had arrLen letter.
  i was a number and i became 0.
  eventually (i == arrLen) because
    perhaps (i % 2 == 0) so 
      arr's i piece became x,
    or maybe (i == 49 || i > 75 && !(i==81)) so
      arr's i piece became z,
    or
      arr's i piece became y.

  arrLen was a number.
  "Choose an array size" spoke,
  what was arrLen?
  perhaps (arrLen < 1) so
    "Choose a size > 0" spoke.
  or maybe (arrLen > 1000) so
    "The array size is too large" spoke.
  or
    charArray(arrLen, 'a', 'b').
